      <h1>Welcome to Your Sleep Insights</h1>
      <p>Track, understand, and improve your sleep using smart sensor data.</p>

      <h2>Inference Summary</h2>
      <div className="insight-box">
        <p><strong>Your overall sleep quality is moderate.</strong> You had around 6 hours and 42 minutes of sleep, which is slightly below the recommended duration of 7â€“8 hours for adults.</p>
        <p>Your <strong>average heart rate</strong> during sleep was 72 BPM, which is within normal range. The <strong>ODI index</strong> (4.5) indicates mild oxygen desaturation events, possibly suggesting early signs of sleep-disordered breathing.</p>
        <p><strong>SpO2 drops</strong> were detected 5 times, which may warrant monitoring over time, especially if you feel daytime fatigue. You spent more time in <strong>light sleep</strong> (40%) compared to <strong>deep sleep</strong> (25%), which may affect body recovery and immune function.</p>

      <h2>What This Dashboard Tells You</h2>
      <div className="info-section">
        <p>This dashboard analyzes data from ECG and EOG signals to help you understand your sleep better. Key areas include duration, sleep stages, oxygen events, and heart rate trends.</p>

      <h2>Sleep Stage Breakdown</h2>
      <div className="grid">
        <div className="card">
          <h3>Light Sleep</h3>
          <p>40% - Transitional phase helping the body prepare for deeper stages. Too much light sleep can indicate restlessness.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="card">
          <h3>Deep Sleep</h3>
          <p>25% - Essential for body recovery, immune support, and hormone regulation.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="card">
          <h3>REM Sleep</h3>
          <p>15% - Crucial for memory and emotion regulation. Eye movement and dreams occur here.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="card">
          <h3>Awake</h3>
          <p>20% - Short awakenings are normal. Excessive awakenings reduce sleep quality.</p>
